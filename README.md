# Randi's Earth Data Science Portfolio
### My brackground is in STEM Education. I'm working to bring real world data to the classroom.
* Thanks for visiting and being patient while I work through [the Earth Analytics Data Science Cert6ificate Course](https://earthlab.colorado.edu/earth-data-analytics-professional-graduate-certificate?utm_source=earthdatascience&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=certificate-2022&utm_id=certificate-2022) from Univ. of Colorado Boulder.

* Not all the work displayed is completely functional, but pseudocode is provided where bugs still need to be worked out. My completed capstone project will be available in August 2025.
