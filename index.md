I have been the Project Coordinator for the Smoky Mountain STEM Collaborative {SMSC} at SCC since 2018. SMSC is part of 
[NASA's SciAct community](https://science.nasa.gov/learn/science-activation-team/). Southwestern is the nation's only 
community college to have a collaborative partnership with NASA which started in 2015. My background is in science education
with experience in the classroom at both the high school and college level. In addition, I have worked as the assistant director
for Western Carolina University's Upward bound Math & Science program. Inspiring young people to answer their own questions and giving
them the tools to do that is my passion.

### SMSC is located at Southwestern Community College shown in the map below.

The land where SCC is located is the ancestral home of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians in the mountains of western North Carolina and 
not far from the Qualla Boundary where the Cherokee People currently reside. Creating an interactive map using Open Street Map was our first assignment.
