I have been the Project Coordinator for the Smoky Mountain STEM Collaborative {SMSC} at SCC since 2018. SMSC is part of 
[NASA's SciAct community](https://science.nasa.gov/learn/science-activation-team/). Southwestern is the nation's only 
community college to have a collaborative partnership with NASA which started in 2015. My background is in science education
with experience in the classroom at both the high school and college level. In addition, I have worked as the assistant director
for Western Carolina University's Upward bound Math & Science program. Inspiring young people to answer their own questions and giving
them the tools to do that is my passion.

# My Projects
1. Adding a Map - we learned to:
* Define geospatial vector data
* Search for geospatial features
* Construct a map and embed it into a portfolio website

### SMSC is located at Southwestern Community College shown in the map below.

The land where SCC is located is the ancestral home of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians in the mountains of western North Carolina and 
not far from the Qualla Boundary where the Cherokee People currently reside. Creating an interactive map using Open Street Map was our first assignment.

2. Climate Coding Challenge - we learned to:
* Analyze temperature data over time
* Parse date information so that it is represented as a datetime type
* Use operators to convert to different units
* Resample time-series data to different frequencies
### Our guided learning focused on Denver Colorado (elevation 5280ft)

### Interactive Map of Veery Migration

The Veery or <i>Catharus fuscescens</i>, is part of the Turdidae family. It is found in the southeastern US during migration and it may be able to anticipate hurricanes in the Atlantic according to a study by Christopher Heckscher. Unfortunately, Atlantic hurricanes tend to coincide with Veery migration and have a negative impact on their breeding season. This is an example of species that is studied in phenology - the impact of a changing climate on the cyclical pattern of an organisms life history.
